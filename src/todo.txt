- [/] chunk multi-therading
- [x] greedy meshing


## greedy meshing

split each chunk into columns,
check if each block in the colum is solid,
check each solid block to see if they have air to the direction we're checking,
get the first row and check if it has any soldi voxels,
if it does check the next row and see if it has solid voxels in the same position,
repeat until you can't any more,
